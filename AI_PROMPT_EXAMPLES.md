# üí¨ AI Prompt Examples - Converting Templates

## üéØ Scenario: You Found a Beautiful Template for Someone Else's Project

You want AI to create something similar but customized for YOUR project.

---

## ‚úÖ BEST Way to Prompt AI

### Example 1: Direct & Clear
```
I found a cool AgentOrchestra template. I want something similar 
but for my NNH AI Studio project (GMB & YouTube management). 

My project:
- Next.js 14 + Supabase
- Dark theme with orange accents (#FF6B00)
- Managing Google My Business locations
- YouTube channel analytics

Can you create a similar landing page but customized for my GMB/YouTube 
management platform?
```

### Example 2: Read Context First
```
Read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md first to understand my project.

I saw an AI Agent orchestration dashboard. I want a similar analytics 
dashboard but for my GMB locations and YouTube channels. Same design 
style but with my data structure.
```

### Example 3: Show What You Want
```
I need a dashboard like the one in this screenshot. But instead of 
orchestrating AI agents, I want to:

- Show my Google My Business locations
- Display YouTube channel stats
- Show analytics charts
- Use my orange color (#FF6B00)

Can you create this page in my current Next.js project structure?
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminders for AI

Always include these when asking for template conversion:

1. **Security**: "Remember to filter by user_id in all queries!"
2. **Branding**: "Use NNH AI Studio branding and orange color"
3. **Architecture**: "Follow my existing Next.js App Router structure"
4. **Data**: "Use my Supabase tables (gmb_locations, gmb_reviews)"
5. **Components**: "Use my existing UI components from /components/ui"

## üí° Pro Tips

### Start with Context
```
Read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
Read CONTEXT_EXPLAINED.md

Now create [feature] based on [template].
```

### Be Specific
‚ùå Bad: "Make this template for me"  
‚úÖ Good: "Create a dashboard page with 4 metric cards showing GMB stats, styled in dark theme with orange accents, fetching from gmb_locations table"

### Show Screenshots
If you can share a screenshot of the template, AI can:
- Understand the exact design
- Replicate the layout
- Match the styling
- Adapt the functionality

### Iterate
```
1. Ask AI to create basic structure
2. Review and say "Add [feature]"
3. "Change colors to my orange theme"
4. "Add data fetching from my tables"
```
