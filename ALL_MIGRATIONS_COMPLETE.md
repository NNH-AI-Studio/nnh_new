## 🧪 Next Steps: Test Sync

Now you can test the GMB Dashboard:

1. **Refresh your browser** on the GMB Dashboard
2. **Click "Sync Data"** button
3. **Watch the console logs** for any errors

## 🔍 What to Check

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ No database schema errors
- ✅ Locations should sync successfully
- ⚠️ Reviews may show 404 (this is a Google API issue we need to fix)

### If You See 404 Errors for Reviews/Media
These are expected based on our earlier investigation. We need to fix the API endpoints:
- Current: `https://mybusiness.googleapis.com/v4/locations/{id}/reviews`
- May need different endpoint or API version
