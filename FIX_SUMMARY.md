# GMB Dashboard Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. Business Insights - 0% Profile Completeness
**Problem:** The component wasn't fetching the `id` field from locations table, causing mapping issues.
**Solution:** 
- Added `id` field to the select query in `components/insights/business-insights.tsx`
- Fixed column names from `reply_text` to `review_reply` and `comment_text` to `comment`

### 2. AI Insights Widget - Missing Data
**Problem:** Similar issue with missing `id` field and incorrect column names.
**Solution:**
- Added `id` field to the select query in `components/dashboard/ai-insights-widget.tsx`
- Corrected column name from `reply_text` to `review_reply`

### 3. GMB Posts Table Missing
**Problem:** The `gmb_posts` table doesn't exist in production database.
**Solution:** Run the migration `20251031_gmb_posts.sql` in Supabase (see DATABASE_MIGRATION_REQUIRED.md)

## Remaining Issues ⚠️

### 1. CSS 400 Errors (rrarhekwhgpgkakqrlyn)
These errors are from Supabase trying to load its own CSS files. This is normal and doesn't affect functionality.

### 2. Runtime Extension Errors
The "runtime.lastError" messages are from browser extensions and not from the application itself.

## Next Steps

1. **Run Database Migration**: Execute the `gmb_posts` table creation script in Supabase SQL editor
2. **Verify Data**: Ensure GMB accounts are properly connected and have location data
3. **Test Insights**: The insights should now properly calculate and display
