# 📊 HAR File Analysis Report

## Files Analyzed
- `www.nnh.ae.har` - Oct 27, 2025
- `attached_assets/nnh.ae_1761774839687.har` - Oct 29, 2025

## ✅ Findings

### All API Requests Successful

- **Profiles**: ✅ Fetching successfully  
- **GMB Locations**: ✅ API calls successful, but returning `[]`
- **GMB Reviews**: ✅ API calls successful, but returning `[]`

### No Errors Detected
- **No 4xx errors**: No client-side errors
- **No 5xx errors**: No server-side errors
- **No network failures**: All requests completed successfully

## 🔍 Conclusion

The HAR files show that:
1. ✅ Authentication is working correctly
2. ✅ Database queries are executing without errors
3. ⚠️ **But the GMB data is empty** - this suggests a **sync issue**, not an error

## 🎯 Root Cause

Based on the successful API responses but empty data, the issue is likely:

### 1. **Data Hasn't Been Synced Yet**
The GMB OAuth connection might be successful, but the initial sync may not have run.

### 2. **Next Steps to Fix**

Run the database migrations from `FINAL_DATABASE_FIX.md` to ensure all tables have the correct schema.

Then test the sync process:
1. Go to GMB Dashboard
2. Click "Sync Data" button
3. Check console for any sync errors

## 📝 Notes

The HAR files are from October 27-29, so they don't reflect the current state after our recent migrations. We need to:
1. ✅ Run migrations first
2. ✅ Then test sync with fresh HAR capture
