# ðŸ”§ GMB Sync Fix Summary

## Problems Fixed

### 1. âœ… Location ID Type Mismatch (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem**: The sync code was using `location.location_id` (TEXT resource name like `accounts/123/locations/456`) when inserting reviews/media into the database. But the schema expects `location_id` to be a UUID referencing `gmb_locations.id`.

**Fix**: 
- Changed `.select('location_id')` to `.select('id, location_id')` at line 481
- Changed `location_id: location.location_id` to `location_id: location.id` in reviews mapping (line 499)
- Changed `location_id: location.location_id` to `location_id: location.id` in media mapping (line 540)

**Impact**: This was causing all reviews and media inserts to fail silently!

### 2. âœ… gmb_media Table Not Found (DISABLED)
**Problem**: Code was trying to upsert media into `gmb_media` table which doesn't exist.

**Fix**: Commented out the media upsert code and replaced with a console log. Added TODO comment.

**Impact**: Media fetching will work but won't be stored until we create the table.

### 3. âœ… Wrong Migration Reference
**Problem**: Error message referenced wrong migration file name.

**Fix**: Changed error message from `20250131_add_missing_columns.sql` to `20251031_gmb_posts.sql`.

## Remaining Issues

### 404 Errors for Reviews/Media Endpoints
The 404 errors are happening because:
1. **Reviews endpoint**: `https://mybusiness.googleapis.com/v4/locations/11247391224469965786/reviews`
2. **Media endpoint**: `https://mybusiness.googleapis.com/v4/locations/11247391224469965786/media`

These endpoints may not exist in the API v4, or the location resource format is wrong.

**Next Steps**: 
1. Check Google Business Profile API v4 documentation for correct reviews/media endpoints
2. May need to use a different API version or endpoint structure

## Testing Required

After these fixes, test:
1. âœ… Run database migrations from `FINAL_DATABASE_FIX.md`
2. âœ… Go to GMB Dashboard
3. âœ… Click "Sync Data" button
4. âœ… Check logs for successful reviews fetch (should not be 404)
5. âœ… Verify reviews appear in dashboard

## Files Modified
- `app/api/gmb/sync/route.ts` - Fixed location_id usage
- `app/api/gmb/posts/list/route.ts` - Fixed error message

## Database Migrations Still Needed
User must run migrations from `FINAL_DATABASE_FIX.md` to create missing columns and tables.
