Perform a full, line-by-line production-grade audit of the entire Dashboard module.

⚠️ IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
This is a live production platform, not a development sandbox. Do NOT modify or reformat code automatically — only analyze, verify, and report. Every suggestion must be safe for production.

1. Scan all dashboard-related folders:
   - `/app/dashboard`
   - `/components/dashboard`
   - `/server/actions/dashboard.ts`
   - `/lib/dashboard`
   - `/lib/supabase`
   - `/server/actions/reviews.ts`, `/accounts.ts`, `/locations.ts` (if referenced by dashboard)

2. Perform an exhaustive analysis covering:
   - **Logic correctness:** verify all data flows, API calls, and state transitions are consistent.
   - **Performance:** detect redundant re-renders, missing caching, large data payloads, or unnecessary suspense boundaries.
   - **Security:** confirm every server action checks for authentication and authorization before returning sensitive data.
   - **Supabase integration:** ensure all queries handle null responses, error codes, and timeouts properly.
   - **GMB API integration:** verify refresh tokens, access tokens, and rate limit handling.
   - **UI stability:** check that all charts, cards, counters, and tables handle empty or delayed data gracefully.
   - **Type safety:** confirm full TypeScript coverage with strict types for server actions, props, and states.
   - **Server/Client boundary:** ensure no server functions are passed directly to Client Components.
   - **Data validation:** detect unvalidated user inputs or missing schema checks.

3. Simulate user interactions:
   - Load the dashboard as a logged-in user and a guest user.
   - Click all dashboard widgets, tabs, filters, and navigation buttons.
   - Monitor console logs and network requests for any runtime warnings, errors, or slow responses.

4. Generate a detailed report:
   - For each file: list findings by severity (critical, warning, minor).
   - Include file name, line number, and explanation.
   - Provide safe recommendations suitable for production (no destructive edits).

5. Do not rewrite files — report only.
