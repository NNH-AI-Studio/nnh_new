 POST https://nnh.ae/api/gmb/create-auth-url 500 (Internal Server Error)
Explanation

Understanding the problem
The console message POST https://nnh.ae/api/gmb/create-auth-url 500 (Internal Server Error) indicates that your server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. Although your client-side JavaScript code sent a valid POST request to the /api/gmb/create-auth-url endpoint, the server-side logic failed to process it successfully. This isn't a client-side issue with your JavaScript code or the network request itself, but rather a problem within the server's application code or its environment.

Your client-side code correctly checks for a non-OK response (!e.ok) and attempts to parse an error message from the server's response body. However, since the server returned a 500 error, the actual issue lies on the server side.

How to verify
To verify the exact cause of the 500 error, you would need to:

Check server logs: Access the server-side logs for your nnh.ae application. Look for logs generated around the time the POST request to /api/gmb/create-auth-url was made. These logs will typically contain detailed stack traces or error messages that explain why the server failed.
Reproduce the error: Attempt to reproduce the error in a development or staging environment where you have more direct access to server-side debugging tools.
Inspect server-side code: Review the code responsible for handling the POST /api/gmb/create-auth-url endpoint to identify potential issues such as unhandled exceptions, database connection problems, incorrect configuration, or external API failures.
Suggested fix
The fix for a 500 Internal Server Error must be applied on the server side. Here are common areas to investigate and potential solutions:

Examine Server Logs: This is the most crucial step. Your server logs will contain specific details about the error.
Action: Access your server's logging system (e.g., console logs for Node.js, PHP error logs, Python traceback logs, cloud provider logs like Google Cloud Logging or AWS CloudWatch). Identify the exact error message and stack trace related to the request to /api/gmb/create-auth-url.
Review Server-Side Code for create-auth-url:
Common issues:
Unhandled exceptions: The code might be throwing an error that isn't caught, causing the server process to crash or return a generic 500.
Missing environment variables or configuration: The server might be trying to access a database connection string, API key, or other configuration that is not set in the production environment.
External API failures: If your server-side code calls an external API (e.g., Google's OAuth API for GMB), that API might be failing or returning an unexpected response.
Database issues: Problems connecting to the database, malformed queries, or database outages can lead to 500 errors.
Invalid input: Although the client sends a POST request, if the server expects specific body content and doesn't receive it, or if it's malformed, it might not handle it gracefully.
Action: Add robust error handling (e.g., try-catch blocks) around any potentially failing operations within your /api/gmb/create-auth-url handler. Ensure all necessary environment variables are correctly configured for your deployment environment.
Return more informative error responses (development best practice): While in production you might return generic 500 errors for security, during development, consider returning more specific error messages from the server, even for 500s.
Example of server-side pseudocode with improved error handling:

// This is a conceptual example for a Node.js-like backend.
// Your actual server-side code will vary based on your language and framework.

router.post('/api/gmb/create-auth-url', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // ... server-side logic to create the auth URL ...

        // Example: Call an external Google API
        const authUrl = await googleAuthService.generateAuthUrl(req.body.someParam);

        if (!authUrl) {
            // Log specific detail on the server for debugging
            console.error('Failed to generate auth URL from Google API: Invalid response');
            return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Could not generate Google Auth URL. Please try again later.' });
        }

        res.status(200).json({ authUrl: authUrl });

    } catch (error) {
        // Log the full error for server-side debugging
        console.error('Server error during create-auth-url:', error);

        // Return a generic 500 error to the client, but log details on the server
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'An unexpected server error occurred.' });
    }
});
Summary
A 500 (Internal Server Error) indicates a problem on your server when processing the POST request to /api/gmb/create-auth-url. The client-side code is handling the non-OK response correctly, but the root cause is server-side. To fix this, you must investigate your server's application logs for detailed error messages and stack traces, then debug and correct the faulty logic within your server's code for that specific endpoint. Implementing robust error handling on the server will help prevent similar issues and provide clearer insights into problems.
